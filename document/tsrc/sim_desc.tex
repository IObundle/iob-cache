The above paragraph describes a desirable simulation setup, but IOb-Cache's
simulation environment still lacks a modular simulation structure. Currently,
only a set of primary non-pipelined write followed by read tests is
implemented. However, IOb-Cache has been thoroughly verified in-system, with two
cache levels. Various open-source RISC-V processors have proven that IOb-Cache
works well: PicoRV32, SSRV, VexRISCV, and DarkRV.
