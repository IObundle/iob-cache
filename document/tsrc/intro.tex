IOb-Cache is a highly configurable, pipelined memory cache designed to bridge
the gap between processing cores and system memory. On the front-end, it
features a versatile processor-side interface that supports AXI4-Lite, Wishbone,
or the proprietary IObundle Native Interface (IOb). The back-end memory-side
interface is equally flexible, offering compatibility with AXI4 or IOb
interfaces. Both the address and data widths are fully parameterizable, ensuring
seamless integration with a wide variety of user cores and memory technologies.

The architecture is based on a $k$-way set-associative structure, where $k$ can
be configured from 1 (direct-mapped) to 8 or more, depending on timing closure
requirements. To suit different application needs, IOb-Cache supports the two
most common write policies: Write-Through Not-Allocate and Write-Back
Allocate. Currently, the IP core is fully verified and operational within
IObundle's IOb-SoC system using the picorv32 CPU, supporting both simulation
environments and FPGA implementations.
