The IObundle CACHE is an open-source pipelined-memory cache. It is a performance-wise and highly configurable IP core. The cache core is isolated from the processor and memory interfaces in order to make it easy to adopt new processors or memory controllers while keeping the core functionality intact. It implements a simple front-end native interface. It also implements an AXI4 interface with configurable data width which allows maximum use of the available memory bandwidth. The IObundle CACHE can be implemented as a Direct-Mapped cache or K-Way Set-Associative cache. It supports both fixed write-through not-allocate policy and write-back policy.
