IOb-Cache is an open-source configurable pipelined memory cache. The
processor-side interface (front-end) uses IObundle's Native Pipelined Interface
(NPI). The memory-side interface (back-end) can also be configured to use NPI or
the widely used AXI4 interface. The address and data widths of the front-end and
back-end are configurable to support multiple user cores and memories. IOb-Cache
is a K-Way Set-Associative cache, where K can vary from 1 (directly mapped) to 8
or more ways, provided the operating frequency after synthesis is
acceptable. IOb-Cache supports the two most common write policies: Write-Through
Not-Allocate and Write-Back Allocate.
