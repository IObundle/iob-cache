In this preliminary version, simulation is not yet fully functional. The
provided testbench merely allows compilation for simulation, and drives the clock
and reset signals. Behavioural memory models to allow pre-synthesis simulation
are already included. In the case of ROMs, their programming data is also
included in the form of .hex files.
