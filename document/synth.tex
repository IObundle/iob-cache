In this preliminary version, synthesis of the IP core without the memories is
functional. The memories are for now treated as black boxes.

It is important not to include the memory models provided in the simulation
directory in synthesis, unless they are to be synthesised as logic. In a
next version, the memories will be generated for the target technology and
included.
